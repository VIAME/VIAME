Vital 0.2.0 Release Notes
=========================

This is a minor release of Vital that provides both new functionality over
the previous v0.1.0 release.  Vital is still considered pre-release software
and subject to significant API changes.  This release is expected to be the
last major/minor release of Vital as a stand-alone package.  The Vital code
is being rolled into the KWIVER repository along with Sprokit and the algorithm
plugins from MAP-Tk, which will be called Arrows.  Combining these repositories
into a single one will simplify development, compilation, and code review.
The Vital repository will be retired once transition is complete.


Updates since v0.1.0
---------------------------------

Absract Algorithms

 * Added an abstract algorithm for computing canonical transforms from maps
   of cameras and points

Bindings

 * Updated current C/Python bindings to function correctly in Vital.

 * Updated IPython notebook (now for use with jupyter)

 * Added minimal bindings for Eigen::Matrix class in C.

 * Added Python wrapping of Eigen::Matrix data using Numpy ndarray type.

 * Added full C/Python bindings for vital::camera_intrinsics class

 * Added full C/Python bindings for vital::covariance_<N, T> class

 * Added full C/Python bindings for vital::rotation_<T> class

 * Added full C/Python bindings for vital::camera class

 * Added full C/Python bindings for vital::descriptor class

 * Added full C/Python bindings for vital::feature class

 * Fixed bug in python ConfigBlock read-from-file.

 * Added more C/Python bindings for vital::track class

 * Added more C/Python bindings for vital::track_set class

 * Added full C/Python bindings for vital::landmark class

Vital Types

 * Fixed vital::covariance_ default constructor to initialize identity
   matrix values instead of not initializing anything.

 * Added geo coordinate types and bounding box.

 * Added vital::any() class to support python bindings.

New features

 * Added classes to support general purpose plugin loading. These are
   designed to support general plugin loading for other kwiver components.

 * Added source file location for origin of thrown exceptions. This can
   be optionally filled in to provide the developer on where the
   exception was detected.

 * Added video input abstract algorithm to support reading from video
   sources. Also added video exception to handle errors from video
   sources.

 * Added klv parsing library to decode metadata embedded in the video
   stream. This parsing code is derived from a previously publically
   released package.

 * Added dump_klv program to display video metadata derived from the
   klv video stream.

 * Added extensible video metadata class to support video metadata from
   video sources.

 * Added algorithm capabilities to allow the concrete algorithms to
   report their capabilities to the algorithm user.

 * Added config explorer tool to help analyze complex config loading
   applications.


Build infrastructure

* Added CMake and c++ code to detect
  - availablilty of symbol demangling support
  - compiler specific std::unique_ptr behaviour

Fixes since v0.1.0
---------------------------------

Vital Types

 * Fixed a bug in which distortion coefficients were not properly captured when
   parsing a camera in KRTD format.
