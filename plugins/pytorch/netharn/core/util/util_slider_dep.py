class SlidingSlices(ub.NiceRepr):
    """
    Generates basis for "sliding window" slices to break a large image into
    smaller pieces. Use it.product to slide across the coordinates.

    DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF SLIDING WINDOW

    Args:
        source (ndarray): array to slice across. It is typically best to ensure
            this is in CHW or CDHW format for maximum compatibility.

        target_shape (tuple): (chan, depth, height, width) of the window
            (be sure to include channels). CHW or CDHW format.

        overlap (float): a number between 0 and 1 indicating the fraction of
            overlap that parts will have. Must be `0 <= overlap < 1`.

        keepbound (bool): if True, a non-uniform step will be taken to ensure
            that the right / bottom of the image is returned as a slice if
            needed. Such a slice will not obey the overlap constraints.
            (Defaults to False)

    Attributes:
        basis_shape - shape of the grid corresponding to the number of steps
            the sliding window will take.
        basis_slices - slices that will be taken in every dimension

    Yields:
        tuple(slice, slice): row and column slices used for numpy indexing

    Example:
        >>> source = np.zeros((220, 220))
        >>> target_shape = (10, 10)
        >>> slider = SlidingSlices(source, target_shape, step=5)

         (slice(5, 15, None), slice(0, 10, None)),
         (slice(5, 15, None), slice(5, 15, None))]
        >>> print('slider.overlap = {!r}'.format(slider.overlap))
        slider.overlap = [0.5, 0.5]

    Example:
        >>> source = np.zeros((250, 200, 200))
        >>> target_shape = (10, 10, 10)
