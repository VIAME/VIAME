KWIVER v1.1.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of KWIVER that provides bug fixes and documentation
improvements over the previous v1.1.0 release.


Updates since v1.1.0
--------------------

Testing

 * The Travis CI framework was updated to download a pre-built Fletch instead
   of building Fletch from source.  This change helps to avoid the Travis CI
   time out.  It also allows us to build all of Fletch and all of KWIVER
   without hitting the time limit, so Sprokit, Python, and track oracle have
   now been enabled in Travis CI testing.

 * Removed duplicate testing headers from kwiver/vital/tests that were unused.
   The copies in kwiver/tests/ are still used.


Fixes since v1.1.0
------------------

Sprokit

 * Previously the Python path used in Sprokit Python tests was incorrect due to
   the missing Python version subdirectory (e.g. 'python2.7/') in the directory
   structure.  This has now been corrected, meaning the tests should pass
   without needing to explicitly set the PYTHONPATH environment variable first.

Testing

 * The sprokit non-blocking pipeline test was failing intermittently and
   taking a long time to run.  Adjustments to the process timing using short
   sleep calls make this test more reliable and run faster.
