KWIVER v1.4.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v1.3.0 release.

Updates since v1.3.0
--------------------

Vital

 * Added constructors taking initalizer lists to mesh types for easier
   initialization.

Vital Bindings

Arrows: Core

 * Added mesh_operations.h, initially with a function to triangulate a mesh.
   That is, subdivide mesh faces into triangles.

Arrows: FFmpeg

Arrows: GDAL

Arrows: OpenCV

Arrows: Serialization

Arrows: VXL

Sprokit

Sprokit: Processes

  * Added new methods which are called when a requested port is
    missing. This can be used to dynamically create ports. Previously
    this was done by overriding the _{input,output}_port_info()
    method.  The new approach is an optimization because the
    _*_port_info() methods are also called to locate ports for data
    transfer. The process specific override can add a lot of overhead
    to the port info calls.
