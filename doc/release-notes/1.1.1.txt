Sprokit
 * Previously the Python path used in Sprokit Python tests was incorrect due to
   the missing Python version subdirectory (e.g. 'python2.7/') in the directory
   structure.  This has now been corrected, meaning the tests should pass
   without needing to explicity set the PYTHONPATH environment variable first.
