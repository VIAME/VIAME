Please note: the core VIAME infastructure is covered under the below permissive
BSD-3 license. That said, the full VIAME build includes over 100 other packages.
The vast majority of these are covered under similar licenses, listed below.
A couple of the optional VIAME add-ons are more restrictive as they integrate
third-party tools, and disabled in the main release. When installing add-ons
consult the description for additional information on a per-add-on basis.
