KWIVER v1.5.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and fixes
over the previous v1.4.0 release.

Updates since v1.4.0
--------------------

Vital

 * Added a parameter to the clone() methods of the track_state, track and
   track_set types controlling whether to make an actual deep copy (default) or
   to make a shallow copy (previous behavior) where elements of the derived
   feature_track_state or object_track_state would still be shared. (This
   change also affects track_set::merge_in_other_track_set(). However, the copy
   constructors of feature_track_state and object_track_state still make only
   shallow copies.)

 * Added a variant of config_block::get_enum_value that accepts a default
   value to fall back on.

 * Added support for registering callbacks to the KWIVER logger.  Callbacks
   receive any message that is logged with the KWIVER logging framework.

Vital Plugin-loader

 * Added support for filtering plugins when they are loaded. Filter
   objects can be added to the plugin loader at run time to select or
   exclude specific plugins.

Vital Util

Vital Logger

 * Log4cplus now searches in more locations to find the log4cplus.properties
   file during start up.  If not found with the environment variable or in the
   current working directory it will now search in the location of the
   executable and also in "../lib/kwiver" relative to the executable.

Vital Tools

Vital Types

 * Added get_vector() member function to access the vector of all metadata on
   a frame in metadata_map.

 * Added ``kwiver::vital::set`` mixin class to define standard set methods as
   well as iterability.

 * Added iterator, const_iterator and iterable classes to support container-
   independent iteration.

Vital Bindings

 * Remove ctypes python bindings

 * Moved python bindings associated with config from sprokit.pipeline to
   vital.config.

Arrows

Arrows: Core

 * Added an algorithm implementation (transform_detected_object_set) for
   transforming detected object sets from one camera perspective to another.
   Implements vital::algo::detected_object_filter.

Arrows: Ceres

Arrows: CUDA

 * Added a new parameter for the truncated signed distance function in depth
   map integration.  The new "Epsilon" value is used in the occluded portion
   of the function that was previously zero.  Setting Epsilon > 0 can remove
   a double surface artifact.  Setting Epsilon = 0 restores the previous
   behavior.

Arrows: FFmpeg

Arrows: GDAL

Arrows: KPF

Arrows: OpenCV

Arrows: Serialization

Arrows: Super3d

Arrows: VXL

Arrows: Python

Sprokit

Sprokit: Processes

 * Added a core sprokit process to shift a stream of detected object
   sets by a specified offset.  When a negative offset is specified,
   detected object sets are initially consumed from the stream until
   the offset is satisfied.  When a positive offset is specified,
   empty detected object sets are prepended to the stream until the
   offset is satisfied.

Tools

 * Converting stand-alone tools to reside under the main "kwiver" top
   level tool. Individual tools are specified as a parameter to the
   "kwiver" tool runner.

 * Moved source of tools/applets and reorganized:
   - tools - contains executables, E.g. kwiver tool runner
   - vital/applets - contains applet framework
   - arrows/core/applets - general applets
