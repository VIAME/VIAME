# DeepSORT Tracker Training Configuration
#
# This configuration file is used with viame when training
# a DeepSORT tracker using the --tracker/-tt option.
#
# DeepSORT training involves training a Re-ID (re-identification) network
# to extract appearance features for matching detections across frames.
#
# Example usage:
#   viame train -i /path/to/training/data -tt deepsort
#
# Or with a custom config:
#   viame train -i /path/to/training/data -c train_deepsort_tracker.conf

# Track reader configuration
track_reader:type = viame_csv

# Tracker trainer configuration

# Model identifier for output files

# Directory for intermediate training files

# Directory for final trained model output
tracker_trainer:deepsort:output_directory = category_models

# Prefix for output model files
tracker_trainer:deepsort:output_prefix = deepsort_tracker

# Number of GPUs to use (-1 for auto-detect)
tracker_trainer:deepsort:gpu_count = -1

# Maximum training epochs

# Batch size for training

# Learning rate

# Confidence threshold for groundtruth filtering
tracker_trainer:deepsort:threshold = 0.00

# Training timeout in seconds (default: 1 week)
tracker_trainer:deepsort:timeout = 604800

# Crop size for Re-ID training (HxW)
tracker_trainer:deepsort:crop_size = 128x64

# Embedding dimension for Re-ID features
tracker_trainer:deepsort:embedding_dim = 512

# Backbone architecture (resnet18 or resnet50)
