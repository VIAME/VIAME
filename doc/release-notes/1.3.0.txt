KWIVER v1.3.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v1.2.0 release.


Updates since v1.2.0
--------------------

 * Loadable modules (algorithms and processes) have been moved under
   the .../lib/kwiver subdirectory so that they will not conflict with
   other packages.

 * Replaces sprokit_private_header_group with kwiver equivalent.

 * Remove unused Sprokit CMake support.

Vital

 * Added new class to format config block to a stream and deprecated
   print method in config_block class. Config block formatter provides
   methods to produce different format outputs. Config block
   formatting can be extended with plugins.

* Added the data_serializer base algorithm to support serialization
  of Vital types for distributed processing and other uses.

Vital Bindings

 * Added python bindings for timestamp class.

Arrows: Core

 * Added support for RPC cameras to the triangulate_landmark implementation.
 * Added a function to render a depth map of a mesh from a perspective camera.

Arrows: FFmpeg

 * Created a new FFmpeg arrow with a video_input algorithm implementation.
   This provides an alternative to the vidl_ffmpeg_video_input in the VXL
   arrow.  The goal is to provide direct access to FFMPEG without requiring
   VXL and to improve efficiency, especially with video seeking.  Currently
   this implementation is not full featured and does not yet provide a
   complete replacement for the VXL implementation.

Arrows: GDAL

 * Created a new GDAL arrow with an image_io algorithm implementation.
   This allows opening images with GDAL, which is especially useful for
   Geospatial image formats like GeoTIFF and NITF.

Arrows: OpenCV

Arrows: Serialization

  * Added JSON Serializers for:
    - bounding_box
    - detected_object (partial)
    - detected_object_set (partial)
    - detected_object_type

  * Added Protocol Buffer Serializers for:
    - bounding_box
    - detected_object (partial)
    - detected_object_set (partial)
    - detected_object_type

Arrows: VXL


Sprokit


Sprokit: Processes

  * Added serializer_process and deserializer_process that convert from/to
    serialized byte strings and Sprokit data ports.

  * Added zmq_transport_send_process and zmq_transport_recieve process to support
    Publish/Subscribe distributed processing with ZeroMQ.

Tools


Unit Tests

Bug Fixes
--------

 * Fixed a problem where ports that were not supplied data in the
   input_adapter_process were incorrectly reported.

 * Fix and issue in the feature_detect_extract_SURF arrow. The arrow was using a dynamicCast
   which causes a segmentation fault on the Mac. On the Mac, symbols exported from an image loaded with
   RTLD_GLOBAL mode are not available to other images unless built with -flat_namespace.

 * Fixed issue with loading logger plugins on Windows due to a semicolon
   that gets appended to environment variables
