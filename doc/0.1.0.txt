VITAL 0.1.0 Release Notes
=========================

This is the first formal release of vital. The features in this
initial release are summarized below.  Future release notes will
describe modifications since the previous release.

Vital is a result of refactoring the common support functionality,
basic types and abstract algorithms from the MapTK package.

Library Features
----------------

Package Configuration, Build System, & Documentation

 * Build system uses CMake as a meta build system for easy build configuration,
   cross-platform compiling, and dashboard regression testing.

 * A unit testing framework using CTest is provided in the 'test' directory.
   This makes writing unit tests easy.

 * CMake scripts are provided to make it very easy to build the MAPTK code
   documentation using Doxygen.  Just turn on the "MAPTK_ENABLE_DOCS" option
   in CMake to create a documentation build target (if you have Doxygen).
   Turn on "VITAL_INSTALL_DOCS" to have to built documentation installed.


Common Support Functionality
----------------------------

* The Logger supports a general purpose logging facility that
  interfaces to some well known logging packages.

* Config management converts config files to internal configuration
  structures. These config blocks are used to specify the behavior of
  algorithms and other software components.

* Video metadata parsing can be used to decode the metadata stream
  in video files.

* Algorithm Plugin loader loads and makes algorithms packaged as
  shared objects available to be instantiated and executed.


Common algorithm data types
---------------------------

This is a collection of data types used by the algorithms and
tools. These data types are needed to interface with the
algorithms. There are also C and python bindings for some of these
types.


Abstract Algorithms
-------------------

The abstract algorithms provide an interface with which to interact
with the concrete algorithms.
