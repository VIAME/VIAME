Building VIAME From Source
==========================

See the platform-specific guides below, though the process is similar for each.
This document corresponds to the example `located online here`_ and also to the
building_from_source example folder in a VIAME installation.

.. _located online here: https://github.com/VIAME/VIAME/tree/master/examples/building_from_source


*****************
Building on Linux
*****************

These instructions are designed to help build VIAME on a fresh machine. They were written for
and tested on Ubuntu 16.04. Other Linux machines will have similar directions, but some steps
(particularly the dependency install) may not be exactly identical. VIAME has also been built
on: CentOS/RHEL 6+, Fedora 19+, and Ubuntu 16.04+ at a minimum.

Install Dependencies
====================

Different Linux distributions may have different packages already installed, or may
use a different package manager than apt, but on Ubuntu this should help to provide
a starting point:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install git zip git wget curl libcurl4-openssl-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libexpat1-dev \
     libgtk2.0-dev libxt-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev liblapack-dev openssl libssl-dev g++ zlib1g-dev 

And on CentOS 7:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo yum -y groupinstall 'Development Tools'
   sudo yum install -y zip git wget openssl openssl-devel zlib zlib-devel freeglut-devel \
     mesa-libGLU-devel lapack-devel libXt-devel libXmu-devel libXi-devel expat-devel readline-devel \
     curl curl-devel atlas-devel file which

If using VIAME_ENABLE_PYTHON, versions 3.6 or above is required with development packages and also
pip installed, with 3.6, 3.8 and 3.10 the most tested versions. For example,
[Anaconda3 2021.05](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/) could be used, though you also try using
native python, e.g. install python3, python3-dev, and numpy (or alternatively whatever python
distribution you want to use),
e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install python3.8 python3.8-dev python3-pip

If using VIAME_ENABLE_CUDA for GPU support, you should install CUDA (version 11.0 or above
is required, 12.4 being the most tested version. Other versions may work depending
on your build settings but are not officially supported yet):

.. code-block:: bash

   https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive

Install CMAKE
=============

Depending on the OS, the version of cmake you get with your local package manager (apt/yum/dnf)
is sometimes too old to use for building VIAME (you currently need at least CMake 3.13) so you may
or may not need to do a manual install of CMake. First you could try using the package manager
then running 'cmake --version' to see if it's appropriate. If a manual install is required, go
to the cmake website, ``https://cmake.org/download``, and download the appropriate binary
distribution (for Ubuntu, this would be something like cmake-3.27.1-Linux-x86_64.sh,
though newer versions will be out by the time you read this). Alternatively, download the
appropriate binary distribution (for Ubuntu, this would be something like cmake-3.27.1-Linux-x86_64.sh,
though newer versions will be out by the time you read this), or for windows the .msi or .zip
installer. Lastly the source version could be built using the below instructions, though this
is usually not necessary if a binary version is available for your platform.


.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/Downloads
   tar zxfv cmake-3.27.1.tar.gz
   cd cmake-3.27.1
   ./bootstrap --system-curl --no-system-libs
   make
   sudo make install
   sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/cmake /bin/cmake

These instructions build the source code into a working executable, installs the
executable into a personal system directory, and then lets the operating system
know where that directory is so it can find cmake in the future in case
/usr/local/bin isn't in your PATH variable by default.

Clone the Source Code
=====================

With all our dependencies installed, we need to build the environment for VIAME
itself. VIAME uses git submodules rather than requiring the user to grab each 
repository totally separately. To prepare the environment and obtain all the
necessary source code, use the following commands. Note that you can change ``src``
o whatever you want to name your VIAME source directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:Kitware/VIAME.git src
   cd src
   git submodule update --init --recursive

Build VIAME
===========

VIAME may be built with a number of optional plugins--VXL, PyTorch, OpenCV,
Scallop-TK, and Matlab--with a corresponding option called VIAME_ENABLE_[option],
in all caps. For each plugin to install, you need a cmake build flag setting the
option. The flag looks like ``-DVIAME_ENABLE_OPENCV:BOOL=ON``, of course changing
OPENCV to match the plugin. Multiple plugins may be used, or none. If uncertain what
to turn on, it's best to just leave the default enable and disable flags which will
build most (though not all) functionalities. At a minimum, these are core components
we recommend leaving turned on:


+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Flag                         | Description                                                                           |

And a number of flags which control which system utilities and optimizations are built, e.g.:

+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Flag                         | Description                                                                                 |

+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

VIAME can be built either in the source directory tree or in a seperate build
directory (recommended). Replace "[build-directory]" with your location of choice,
and run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir [build-directory]
   cd [build-directory]
   cmake [build_flags] [path_to_source_tree]
   make -j8 # or just make for a unthreaded build

Depending on which enable flags you have set and your system configuration, you may
need to set additional cmake variables to point to dependency locations. An example
is below for a system with CUDA, Python, and Matlab enabled, though the versions are
old. Please do not use CUDA <10 or python 2.7 anymore.

.. _mac-label:

*******************
Building on Mac OSX
*******************

Building on Mac is very similar to Linux, minus the dependency install stage.
Currently, we have only tested VIAME with OSX 10.11.5 and Clang 7.3.0, but other
versions may also work. Make sure you have a C/C++ development environment set up,
install git, install cmake either from the source or a using a binary installer, and
lastly, follow the same Linux build instructions above.

.. _windows-label:

*******************
Building on Windows
*******************

Building on windows can be very similar to Linux if using a shell like cygwin
(``https://www.cygwin.com/``), though if not you may want to go grab the GUI
ersions of CMake (``https://cmake.org/``) and TortoiseGit (``https://tortoisegit.org/``).
Currently Visual Studio 2019 is supported and the most tested version.

First do a Git clone of the source code for VIAME. If you have TortoiseGit this
involves right clicking in your folder of choice, selecting Git Clone, and then
entering the URL to VIAME (``https://github.com/VIAME/VIAME.git``) and the location
of where you want to put the downloaded source code.

Next, do a git submodule update to pull down all required packages. In TortoiseGit
right click on the folder you checked out the source into, move to the TortoiseGit
menu section, and select ``Submodule Update``.

Next, install any required dependencies for items you want to build. If using CUDA,
version 11.0 or above is desired, along with Python 3.6+. Other versions have yet to
be tested extensively, though may work. On Windows it can also be beneficial to use
Anaconda to get multiple python packages. Boost Python (turned on by default when
Python is enabled) requires Numpy and a few other dependencies.

Finally, create a build folder and run the CMake GUI (``https://cmake.org/runningcmake/``).
Point it to your source and build directories, select your compiler of choice, and
setup and build flags you want.

The biggest build issues on Windows arise from building VIAME in super-build and
exceeded the windows maximum folder path length. This will typically manifest as build
errors in the kwiver python libraries. To bypass these errors you have 2 options:

1. Build VIAME in as high level as possible (e.g. C:/VIAME) or, alternatively
2. Set the VIAME_BUILD_KWIVER_DIR path to be something small outside of your
   superbuild location, e.g. C:/tmp/kwiver to bypass path length limits. Thi
   is performed, for example, in the nightly build server cmake script as an
   example https://github.com/VIAME/VIAME/blob/master/cmake/build_server_windows.cmake


.. _tips-label:

**************
Updating VIAME
**************

If you already have a checkout of VIAME and want to switch branches or
update your code, it is important to re-run:

``git submodule update --init --recursive``

After switching branches to ensure that you have on the correct hashes
of sub-packages within the build (e.g. fletch or KWIVER). Very rarely
you may also need to run:

``git submodule sync``

Just in case the address of submodules has changed. You only need to
run this command if you get a "cannot fetch hash #hashid" error.

********************
Build Tips 'n Tricks
********************

**Super-Build Optimizations:**

When VIAME is built as a super-build, multiple solutions or makefiles are generated
for each individual project in the super-build. These can be opened up if you want
to experiment with changes in one and not rebuild the entire superbuild. VIAME
places these projects in [build-directory]/build/src/* and fletch in
[build-directory]/build/src/fletch-build/build/src/*. You can also run ccmake or
the cmake GUI in these locations, which can let you manually change the build settings
for sub-projects (say, for example, if one doesn't build).


**Python:**

The default Python used is 3.8, though other versions may work as well. It depends on
your build settings, operating system, and which dependency projects are turned on.


.. _issues-label:

******************
Known Build Issues
******************

**Issue:**

When compiling with CUDA turned on:

.. code-block:: console

   nvcc fatal   : Visual Studio configuration file 'vcvars64.bat' could not be found for
   installation at 'Microsoft Visual Studio XX.0/VC/bin/x86_amd64/../../..'

or similar.

**Solution:**

Express/Community versions of visual studio don't ship with a file called vcvars64.bat
You can add one manually be placing a bat file called 'vcvars64.bat' in folder
'Microsoft Visual Studio XX.0\VC\bin\amd64' for your version of visual studio. This
file should contain just a single line:

``CALL setenv /x64``


**Issue:**

Boost fails to build early with error in *_out.txt:

.. code-block:: console

   c++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)

**Solution:**

You are likely running out of memory and your C++ compiler is crashing (common on VMs
with a small amount of memory). Increase the amount of memory availability to your VM or
buy a better computer if not running a VM with at least 1 Gb of RAM.


**Issue:**

On VS2015 with Python enabled: ``error LNK1104: cannot open file 'python27_d.lib'``

**Solution:**

If you want to link against python in debug mode, you'll have to build Python itself
to enable debug libraries, as the default python distributions do not contain them.
Alternatively switch to Release or RelWDebug modes.


**Issue:**

.. code-block:: console

   ImportError: No module named numpy.distutils

**Solution:**

You have python installed, but not numpy. Install numpy.


**Issue:**

``cannot find cublas_v2.h`` or linking issues against CUDA

**Solution:**

VIAME contains a ``VIAME_DISABLE_GPU_SUPPORT`` flag due to numerous issues relating to
GPU code building. Alternatively you can debug the issue (incorrect CUDA drivers for
OpenCV, Torch, etc...), or alternatively not having your CUDA headers set to be in your include path.


**Issue:**

.. code-block:: console

   CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:200 (message):
     Unable to locate CUDNN library

**Solution:**

You have enabled CUDNN but the system is unable to locate CUDNN, as the message says.

Note CUDNN is installed seperately from CUDA, they are different things.

You need to set the VIAME flag CUDNN_LIBRARY to something like /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn.so.
Alternatively you can set CUDNN_ROOT to /usr/local/cuda/lib64 manually if that's where you installed it.


**Issue:**

When ``VIAME_ENABLE_DOC`` is turned on and doing a multi-threaded build, sometimes the build fails.

**Solution:**

Run ``make -jX`` multiple times, or don't run ``make -jX`` when ``VIAME_ENABLE_DOCS`` is enabled.


**Issue:**

CMake says it cannot find MATLAB

**Solution:**

Make sure your matlab CMake paths are set to something like the following

.. code-block:: console

   Matlab_ENG_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=[matlab_install_loc]/bin/glnxa64/libeng.so
   Matlab_INCLUDE_DIRS:PATH=[matlab_install_loc]/extern/include
   Matlab_MEX_EXTENSION:STRING=mexa64
   Matlab_MEX_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=[matlab_install_loc]/bin/glnxa64/libmex.so
   Matlab_MX_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=[matlab_install_loc]/bin/glnxa64/libmx.so
   Matlab_ROOT_DIR:PATH=[matlab_install_loc]
