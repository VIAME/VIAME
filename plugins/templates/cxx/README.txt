This directory contains the source files needed to make a loadable
detector algorithm implementation. The intent is to copy the contents
of this directory to a new folder in the plugins directory.



Change the following place holders to instantiate a new detector.

@template@ - name of the detector.

@template_lib@ - name of the plugin library that will contain the
detector. Can be the same name as the detector.

@template_dir@ - name of the source directory containing the detector
files.

The place holders also appear in capital letters indicating that the
replacement string should be capitalized.
