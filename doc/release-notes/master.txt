KWIVER v1.2.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v1.2.0 release.


Updates since v1.2.0
--------------------

 * Loadable modules (algorithms and processes) have been moved under
   the .../lib/kwiver sugdirectory so that they will not conflict with
   other packages.

 * Replaces sprokit_private_header_group with kwiver equivalent.

 * Remove unused sprokit cmake support.

Vital


Vital Bindings

 * Added python bindings for timestamp class.

Arrows: Core


Arrows: FFmpeg

 * Created a new FFmpeg arrow with a video_input algorithm implementation.
   This provides an alternative to the vidl_ffmpeg_video_input in the VXL
   arrow.  The goal is to provide direct access to FFMPEG without requiring
   VXL and to improve efficency, especially with video seeking.  Currently
   this implementation is not full featured and does not yet provide a
   complete replacement for the VXL implementation.

Arrows: GDAL

 * Created a new GDAL arrow with an image_io algorithm implementation.
   This allows opening images with GDAL, which is especially useful for
   Geospatial image formats like GeoTIFF and NITF.

Arrows: OpenCV


Arrows: VXL


Sprokit


Sprokit: Processes


Tools


Unit Tests

Bug Fixes
--------

 * Fixed a problem where ports that were not supplied data in the
   input_adapter_process were incorrectly reported.
