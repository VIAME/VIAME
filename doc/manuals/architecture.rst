Architecture
============

One of the primary design goals of KWIVER is to make it easier to pull
together algorithms from a wide variety of third-party, open source
image and video processing projects and integrate them into highly
modular, run-time configurable systems.

This goal is achieved through the three main components of KWIVER: Vital, Arrows, and Sprokit.
