KWIVER v1.5.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of KWIVER that provides fixes over the previous
v1.5.0 release.

Bug Fixes since v1.5.0
----------------------

Vital

 * Added a missing include file in track.cxx required to build on MSVC 2019.

Arrows: Core

 * Fixed a bug in initialize_cameras_landmarks_keyframe in which the
   principal point was not initialized from the image size unless there
   was also metadata useful for determining focal length.  Distortion
   parameters were also not properly preserved in this initialization
   and this has also been resolved.

Arrows: OpenCV

 * Fixed a long standing bug with memory management when converting between
   OpenCV and Vital images.  Reference counting was not handled correctly.
   A workaround was previously added that forced a deep copy, but this created
   another bug resulting in images with invalid first_pixel() values.
   Both of these issues have been addressed.
