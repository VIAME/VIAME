# SRNN Tracker Training Configuration
#
# This configuration file is used with viame_train_detector when training
# an SRNN (Siamese RNN) tracker using the --tracker/-tt option.
#
# SRNN training involves multiple stages:
# 1. Data preparation - Convert tracks to KW18 format
# 2. Siamese model training - Train appearance feature extractor
# 3. Feature extraction - Extract features using trained Siamese
# 4. Individual LSTM training - Train A/I/M/B LSTMs
# 5. Combined SRNN training - Train final TargetLSTM model
#
# Example usage:
#   viame_train_detector -i /path/to/training/data -tt srnn
#
# Or with a custom config:
#   viame_train_detector -i /path/to/training/data -c train_srnn_tracker.conf
