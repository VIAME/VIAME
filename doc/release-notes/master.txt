KWIVER v1.6.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and fixes
over the previous v1.5.0 release.

Updates since v1.5.0
--------------------

 * Renamed symbols or other approaches to reduce "shadowing" warnings.

Vital

Vital Algo

 * Extended the API for compute_depth to also return an uncertainty image.

Vital Applets

 * Added utility functions to help validate config file entries for input
   and output files and directories.

Vital Types

 * Add new method to metadata class to add a metadata item being
   passed by shared_ptr

Vital Plugin-loader

 * Added support for filtering plugins when they are loaded. Filter
   objects can be added to the plugin loader at run time to select or
   exclude specific plugins.

 * Added optional bit mask to load_all_plugins() which allows selected
   groups of plugins to be loaded. In addition the build/install
   directory structure for the plugins was reorganized.

 * Internal change to consolidate determining and configuring the
   build-time plugin search paths.

Vital Util

Vital Logger

Vital Tools

Vital Types

Vital Bindings

 * Remove ctypes python bindings

 * Moved python bindings associated with config from sprokit.pipeline to
   vital.config.

 * Force logging level of TRACE to be DEBUG in bindings because Python logging
   does not support the TRACE level.

Arrows

 * Cleaned up arrows library links.  Many arrows linked to the core arrow
   when really only needed to link directly to vital libraries.

Arrows: Core

 * Updated dump-klv applet to load default configuration from a file.

 * Added a utility function to depth_utils.h to find similar cameras by view
   angle.

 * Added a utility funciton to depth_utils.h to gather corresponding cameras,
   images, and masks from video sources for use in depth map estimation.

Arrows: Ceres

 * Improve logging in bundle_adjust to allow logging per-iteration summaries
   and independently control logging fully summaries after optimization
   completes.

Arrows: CUDA

Arrows: FFmpeg

 * Added a libavfilter pipeline into the ffmpeg_video_input reader. This
   allows users to inject filters in the video reader, much the same as
   is possible in the ffmpeg command line with the -vf option.  The default
   filter applies deinterlacing to any interlaced frames.

 * Fixed the memory leak that occurred when a video was opened and closed.

Arrows: GDAL

Arrows: KPF

Arrows: MVG

 * Created new MVG arrow to make a new home for Multi-View Geometry and
   other 3D vision code.  Much of this code will move from the "core" arrow
   which had grown too large.

 * Moved track_features applet from core into mvg.

 * Moved the following algorithms from core into mvg:
   - hierarchical_bundle_adjust
   - initialize_cameras_landmarks_keyframe (renamed to initialize_cameras_landmarks)
   - initialize_cameras_landmarks (renamed to initialize_cameras_landmarks_basic)
   - triangulate_landmarks

 * Moved the following utility headers from core into mvg:
   - epipolar_geometry.h
   - interpolate_camera.h
   - necker_reverse.h
   - metrics.h
   - projected_track_set.h
   - sfm_utils.h
   - transform.h
   - triangulate.h

 * Added a new applet, init_cameras_landmarks, to run the estimate cameras
   and landmarks from feature tracks produced by the track_features applet.

Arrows: OpenCV

Arrows: Serialization

Arrows: Super3d

 * Changed the compute_depth parameters to take a sampling rate, in pixels,
   instead of an absolute number of depth slices.  This allows the algorithm
   the scale the number of slices appropriatlely ensuring at least a minimum
   sampling rate when projecting into support images.

 * Updated the Super3D compute_depth algorithm to compute uncertainty.

Arrows: VTK

 * Created new VTK arrow.

 * Added utility function to convert depth images to vtkImageData.
   This function was ported from TeleSculptor.

 * Added an applet to estimate depth maps from multple views.

 * Added a new applet for fusing depth maps in volume and extracting a
   surface mesh.

Arrows: VXL

Arrows: Python

Sprokit

Sprokit: Processes

 * Added four new PyTorch-using Python Sprokit processes for tracking
   (srnn_tracker), descriptor computation (alexnet_descriptors and
   resnet_descriptors), and augmentation (resnet_augmentation).

Sprokit: Bindings

 * Removed redundant logger support sprokit.sprokit_logging module.

Tools

Build System

 * Added a new build flag, KWIVER_ENABLE_PYTORCH, to include
   PyTorch-dependent code in the build.

 * Enabled the use of folders for CMake targets to provided better
   organization in IDEs that support folders, like Visual Studio.

Unit Tests

General Documentation

Bug Fixes
---------

Arrows: Core

Arrows: Ceres

Arrows: Super3D

Sprokit: Processes

 * Fixed the compute_track_descriptors process's handling of null
   output from its nested algorithm.
